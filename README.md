## Research Question 

This project is an extension of the mini-project1. 
For this project, I am still going to study the trending books from 2011 to 2021. I want to track how the popular book themes/genres have changed over the years.
My hypotheses are the following: 

(1) The themes and genres that readers are interested in don't stay constant; 

(2) The popularity varies depending on the social and political environments at the time; 

(3) Book preference can reveal readers’ attitudes toward the ongoing social and political events. 

The study is meaningful because we might be able to infer people's thoughts and attitudes from their book preference, and understand how the environment can shape people's preference. 


## Introduction 
The project is inspired by Nghiem et al. (2016). The study used google trend data to track the most appealing conversation topics to the general public each year from 2004 to 2013, and can therefore infer about people’s change in interests and attitudes toward some common social issues such as climate change. The finding of the study shows that what people search for can reflect their thoughts and values, and their searching interests depend heavily on social trends. Based on the results of the study, I wonder if what people look for in books can also reflect their interests and attitudes toward social issues and whether their book preference is influenced by the environment. Past studies have shown that book preference speaks about the reader’s empathy level and mentalizing ability (Pino & Mazza 2016; Bal & Veltkamp 2013). More specifically, reading fiction books is associated with a higher empathy level and an improved mentalizing ability. However, few studies have investigated that how book preference can predict readers’ attitudes. Although book preference can't reflect the real-time attitude of the readers as Google Trend, it still has the capability to inform us about the clear changes of attitudes regarding specific book themes and genres on a yearly basis. Moreover, it still remains unanswered if people’s preference changes with the environment. According to the “reflection theory”, literature mirrors what is happening in the real world (Inglis 1938). But this theory is based on the writer’s perspective, more research is needed to understand if the reader’s literary preference also reflects the real-world situation. Thus, by asking the research question, I can understand whether the book preference resonates with reality and how the change in preference might show the reader’s attitude toward the ongoing social and political events.    


## Data
I collected the data from the Barnes & Noble website which documents its best-selling books on a yearly basis. I scraped the information of the top 200 best-selling books from each year between 2011 and 2021. The information that I am interested in is the content of the book overview and editorial reviews. Book overview and editorial reviews generally give a good summary of what the book is about so we are able to derive the book themes/genres from them. After getting the raw text, I can build machine learning models to compute and compare the frequency of topic occurrence in each year. As a result, I will have a good idea about what themes and genres are most popular throughout the years.  

## Methods
I implemented both a topic model and a dynamic topic model (DTM) to study my research question. I think it will be interesting to compare how the results generated by the two models may differ. Both models are based on the LDA algorithm and are used to deduce abstract topics from a text corpus so I will be able to obtain the book themes and genres as desired.   The topic model is used to study the books from all years as a whole. It groups the raw texts of the book information into several clusters of topics. By applying a topic model, I can understand how many themes/genres can the books be grouped into and what themes/genres are shared by all books in the past 11 years. I am also able to know the set of words that are associated with each theme and the theme that dominates each year. I can learn the same information by using a DTM. But, the DTM takes a step further to take into consideration of the temporal effect. According to Blei & Lafferty (2006), a DTM can make better predictions if the themes in a set of documents evolve over time. Instead of treating the themes of books from all years with equal weight, we probably want to capture the dynamics and have the distribution of themes change based on a time slice (such as “years” for answering my research question).  

## Findings 
Based on the results generated from the general topic model, the number of topics that produce the best coherence score is 2.

There are some overlaps in the words that are closely related to the two topics. For instance, ‘world’, ‘life’, and ‘family’ show up in both topics. But, when taking a closer look, we can learn that one topic (topic 0) centers around themes (e.g. war and power) that are associated with books in history and politics. The other (topic 1) centers around themes (e.g. school and library) that are commonly seen in books that target young adults and children. Hence, topic 0 might be the cluster for non-fiction books and topic 1 is the cluster for fiction books. According to the number of tokens counted for each topic, the non-fiction cluster (~70%) is much more popular than the fiction cluster (~30%). This trend is confirmed when I plotted the dominant topics over time. Topic 0 consistently beats topic 1 throughout the 11 years. Notably, there was a spike in the popularity of topic 0 and a dip in the popularity of topic 1 in 2015. Based on the result obtained from the topic model, it seems that my hypothesis was wrong. People consistently prefer the same types of books over time.

However, when using the dynamic topic model, we are able to observe fine-grained patterns that look different. The time interval set for the model was ‘year’. The number of topics was set to 3 and the number of time slices was set to 11. By clustering the book themes/genres with 3 topics, there is less overlap between the clustered groups. Topic 0 contains themes (e.g. famili and school) that are associated with children/young adults’ books. Topic 1 contains themes (e.g. war and power) that are generally seen in historical and political books. Topic 2 is a cluster of thriller books and fairytale books. Now, by having more subcategories of book themes/genres and by taking into account the temporal influence, we do see variations in book preference across the years. The historical and political books (topic 1) were most popular before 2016. After that, its popularity sharply decreased. In contrast, the other two topics became more popular and eventually surpassed the popularity of topic 1 books. The results indicate that my hypothesis might have some credibility so that people’s preference doesn’t stay constant.

Although no causal relationship can be drawn from the study results, we can still ask “could the change in book preference be related to the presidential election? “ because we do see a significant difference in the popularity of historical and political books around 2015 and 2016. Seemingly, people have lost their interest in history and politics since 2016, and have switched to reading more fiction. One notable event that happened around that time was Donald Trump’s running for the presidency. Certainly, further investigation is needed to actually build the connection between book preference and the presidential election.
